The manager level determines the number of employees you can have in your fleet, which in turn defines which neighborhood you can go to. To build a fleet of workers we must mint route managers and delivery men with vehicles, for example for a level 1 manager you must have 1 delivery man that adds up to 200 Mine Power, in the case of a level 2 manager you can have up to 2 delivery men and so on, then the person in charge must pay the rent of a sector of the store so that the workers make the deliveries, and a hiring cost for each employee, the delivery men must pay the gasoline for the vehicle and materials to work, finally a neighborhood is chosen to bring the cast according to the obtained Mine Power. The missions will have a chance of success that will depend on the climatic difficulties that are presented to us in our cast, the climates are sunny, windy or rainy days, the player will have the option to choose the climate they want. Workers will be able to perform their missions once every 24 hours, reactivating at 00:00 UTC each day.</p>
